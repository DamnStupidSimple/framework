Damn Stupid Simple is a micro framework built for lazy developers. The core is very small in size, yet it contains most of the functions required to rapidly start developing a project. The name itself is obvious.

It is everything you need to run from small to large-scale projects.

  - No Nonsense
  - Extremely Extensible (to your own style)
  - Very Small in Size
  - Very Fast (<20 ms)

Here's some of the technical features:

  - Simple Templating Process
  - Simple Routing Engine
  - Integrated with Composer
  - Integrated with Eloquent ORM
  - Dependency Injection
  - Out-of-the-Box Error Handler

Not ready to jump into the "bandwagon" of framework? 

> New programmers have to take extra effort to learn 
> everything about modern PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symphony. Most 
> of the time were spent on documentations rather than the actual codes.
> This leads to the development of Damn Stupid Simple, as the surface of
> every terminologies, and the entry level to modern day needs.
